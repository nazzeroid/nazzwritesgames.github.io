			<p class="introduction">Have you ever wondered what your favorite game would be like in a theme park ride, like the ones in Universal Studios or Walt Disney world? Get excited thinking about how COOL a particular ride would be, wishing it would just exist already? Great, me too! With the recent release of <em>SUPER MARIO WORLD</em> in Japan, we at <em id="red"><strong>[REDACTED]</strong></em> have been brainstorming our own ideas for OUR favorite video games here at the office! My co-workers weren't that into it. But that's okay! I've taken it upon myself to ask strangers on the internet for cool ride ideas! Sure, we can't make them come to life, but at least we can all brainstorm and partake in some level of escapism. Before you is a list of my TOP 7 favorite ride ideas. If yours is not on the list, then oh well. Better luck next time. Let's get into it!</p>

			<ol class="list">
				<li> Sam & Max </li>
				  <img src="https://www.thunderchunky.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/sam-and-max-1.jpg">
				    <p class="src">Art by Steve Purcell</p>
				      <p class="p1"><em>Sam & Max</em> was initially created by Steve Purcell as a comic in 1987. The story follows a duo of freelance police officersâ€”an anthropomorphic dog and rabbitâ€”who embark on absurd crime-fighting adventures. They engage in quippy banter throughout their escapades.</p>
				        <h6>THE IDEA</h6>
				      <p class="idea1">"Dude, I LOVE Sam & Max. I've been thinking of this for years. Okay, so... Riders would hop into the DeSoto-- since it's a 4-seated car. You know how you can drive around to progress the story in the Wii Games? And how Sam can use his gun? It would be really fun to make only one person have access to the gun while the nearest passenger takes the wheel. It would be so amazing and also that would remind me a lot of the VR game"</p>

				    <br>
				<li>Resident Evil</li>
				  <img src="https://images.nintendolife.com/26419a7a6011e/na.900x.jpg">
				    <p class="p1">The <em>Resident Evil</em> games are a big fan favorite. The first game was released in 1996 and was published by Capcom. The games revolve around battling zombies and other bio-organic creatures while uncovering dark secrets in a sinister setting.</p>
				      <h6>THE IDEA</h6>
				        <p class="idea1">"I got one. Resident Evil. I think it would be a moving track shooter that shakes as you shoot the infected and then have two escape scenarios where you're running from Nemesis/Mutant Nemesis around Raccoon City"</p>
				      <p class="from">â€”hombre hormiga on [REDACTED WEBSITE]</p>
				    <br>
				<li>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</li>
				  <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oF-R22SNL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg">
				    <p class="p1"><em>The Legend of Zelda</em> is one of my favorite Nintendo series. And <em>The Wind Waker</em> is my favorite Zelda game! It was released in 2003 for the Nintendo GameCube and guys- this game is so pretty! There's a sense of light-heartedness to Toon Link's facial expressions despite your sister getting kidnapped, and you bearing the sole responsibility to save Hyrule from an ancient evil once again...</p>
				      <h6>THE IDEA</h6>
				        <p class="idea1">"Wind Waker would definitely be a water ride, on a boat that looks like The King of Red lions. I don't know what kind of story you could do, maybe shoot cannons at the giant bird that kidnapped Aryll?? And a whirlpool would be cool but I don't think you could fake that in a theme park :("</p>

				    <br>
				<li>Super Mario Galaxy</li>
				  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/76/SuperMarioGalaxy.jpg">
				    <p class="p1">Okay. Now, I know we have Super Mario World now, but wouldn't it be fun to have a <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>-themed ride? The game was released in late 2007 for the Wii. In this entry, players guide Mario through the vastness of space on an adventure to save Princess Peach from Bowser's clutches. The game's innovative gameplay, captivating visuals, and charming storyline have made it a beloved classic in the Super Mario series.</p>
				      <h6>THE IDEA</h6>
				        <p class="idea1">"it would b so cool if we had a super mario galaxy ride dat was a lot like the harry potter one???? and u can traverse through the solar system and even help mario and a luma save peach!!! ðŸ¥º"</p>
				    <p class="from">â€”xXxPHANTASMAxXx on [REDACTED WEBSITE]</p>
				    <br>
				<li>Phasmophobia</li>
				  <img src="https://cdn2.steamgriddb.com/file/sgdb-cdn/grid/b8ee42f6c6733d5db34b17a5aaa5844d.png">
				    <p class="p1">Have you ever wanted to be a paranormal investigator? Well, now you can!<em>Phasmophobia</em> has amassed a lot of success since it first released in 2020. It is a cooperative horror game where you must explore haunted houses, gather evidence, and identify various types of supernatural entities while dealing with chilling encounters ("ghost events" according to some fans).</p>
				      <h6>THE IDEA</h6>
				        <p class="idea1">"phasmo would definitely have a horror nights haunted house omg... they can assign u some tools while the ghosts 'react' to ur evidence and the ghosts can be actors lol"</p>

				    <br>
				<li>Luigi's Mansion</li>
				  <img src="https://mario.wiki.gallery/images/3/3e/Luigi%27s_Mansion_Box.png">
				    <p class="p1"><em>Luigi's Mansion</em> is a Super Mario spin-off that was released in 2001 on the GameCube. The game follows Luigi, who inherits a mansion and tries to save Mario, who is trapped in a painting until the end of the game. Personally, this is one of my favorite games, and a favorite for others too! After all, one should cheer for the underdog!</p>
				      <h6>THE IDEA</h6>
				        <p class="idea1">"I WOULD F*CKING LOVE A LUIGI'S MANSION RIDE!! IT COULD BE JUST LIKE THE HAUNTED MANSION BUT WAY BETTER!! U COULD WEAR 3D GLASSES AND SEE THINGS FLYING AT YOU AND IT COULD SHAKE THE CART SO ITS LIKE A GHOST MOVING THE RIDE AND MAYBE SOME SPRINKLERS WHEN YOU COME OUTSIDE THE MANSION SO IT FEELS LIKE RAIN??? THEN IT COULD END WITH LUIGI IN A BOSS FIGHT WITHA BIG GHOST"</p>

				<li>Earthbound</li>
				  <img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/yA0AAOSwQWBdfGGw/s-l1600.jpg">
				    <p class="p1"><em>Earthbound</em> is one of the greatest JRPGs from the 90s. The game went on to inspire Toby Fox to create <em>UNDERTALE</em>, and has gained a passive popularity on social media. The game follows the "chosen four"â€” a boy named Ness and his three friends, Paula, Jeff, and Poo. With their special abilities, they must come together to fulfill a prophecy and destroy an evil monster that seeks to destroy the world in 10 years.
				    	<br>
				    <em>"...The legends from the ancient times tell of three boys and a girl who defeat Giygas."</em></p>
				      <h6>THE IDEA</h6>
				        <p class="idea1">"My favorite game is Earthbound,,,, I already have a plot idea. Maybe Andonuts is testing a new type of Sky Runner and he enlists the riders' help? There's window-screens inside. Two of you can drive, like the Star Wars one. You eventually crash in the Threed cave and get attacked by zombies until Ness and co. come to the rescue! Then Porky shows up with his machine and you get a signal that you're 'unstuck' and can drive away... Then hijinks ensue across Eagleland/Foggyland as you run from Porky or somethin... Maybe the rider limit would be a party of 4"</p>
